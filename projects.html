            information from several diffrent sources: SheCodes API for pexels
            image gallery and Free Dictionary API. In this application you can
            search any English language word and the application is capable of
            showing you an audio file for pronunciation of the word, word
            phonetics, lots of different meanings, synonyms, examples in the
            sentence and also a photo gallery related to this word.

            A landing page about the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius was built
            using HTML, CSS. The code is open-sourced on GitHub and the page is
            hosted on Netlify. The page informs the user about Vilnius, tells an
            old legend and also offers several places to visit (embedded maps,
            Instagram pictures) as well as provides infrastructure related
            links.

            A real time weather app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (later
            I also rebuilt it using reqact.js). The code is open-sourced on
            GitHub and the application is hosted on Netlify. The application
            integrates an API from Open weather map. In the application you can
            search for any city in the world and the application will show you
            current weather for that city, including high and low temperature,
            wind speed and a nice icon that describes the current weather. Also
            you will get a prognose for the next 6 days with temperature high
            and low, including a describing icon for the weather conditions.
            I’ve also built a nice extra function with Geolocation API that will
            allow the user to click on the button for the current location
            weather.

          tell a story through simple, memorable design.
