            I designed and developed the official website for Oslo Afro Arts, a
            vibrant cultural organization celebrating African art, music, and
            creativity in Norway. The site features a modern, responsive design
            with intuitive navigation, dynamic event updates, and strong visual
            storytelling. Built with HTML, CSS, and Java Script, it offers an
            engaging user experience while highlighting the rich diversity of
            Afro arts in Oslo.

            Cat Tee is my own e-commerce project, created out of a love for cats
            and cozy, stylish apparel. I designed and built the online store via
            shopify to offer a fun and playful shopping experience, featuring
            original cat-themed t-shirts and accessories. The website is fully
            responsive, easy to navigate, and integrates secure checkout
            options. From the branding to the user interface, every detail was
            crafted to bring a little extra joy to fellow cat lovers around the
            world.

          <div class="p-projects p-5 rounded">
            Dictionary app that was built with React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
            The code is open-sourced on GitHub and the page is hosted on
            Netlify. The application integrates several various API to retrieve
            information from several diffrent sources: SheCodes API for pexels
            image gallery and Free Dictionary API. In this application you can
            search any English language word and the application is capable of
            showing you an audio file for pronunciation of the word, word
            phonetics, lots of different meanings, synonyms, examples in the
            sentence and also a photo gallery related to this word.

          <h4>Vilnius landing page</h4>
          <div class="p-projects p-5 rounded">
            A landing page about the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius was built
            using HTML, CSS. The code is open-sourced on GitHub and the page is
            hosted on Netlify. The page informs the user about Vilnius, tells an
            old legend and also offers several places to visit (embedded maps,
            Instagram pictures) as well as provides infrastructure related
            links.

          <h4>Weather application</h4>
          <div class="p-projects p-5 rounded">
            A real time weather app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (later
            I also rebuilt it using reqact.js). The code is open-sourced on
            GitHub and the application is hosted on Netlify. The application
            integrates an API from Open weather map. In the application you can
            search for any city in the world and the application will show you
            current weather for that city, including high and low temperature,
            wind speed and a nice icon that describes the current weather. Also
            you will get a prognose for the next 6 days with temperature high
            and low, including a describing icon for the weather conditions.
            I’ve also built a nice extra function with Geolocation API that will
            allow the user to click on the button for the current location
            weather.

            World clock application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It
            allows the user to see the time in different cities around the world
            that are in different time zones. The cities can be selected in a
            drop down menu. One of the selections also allows the user to see
            the time in their current location.
